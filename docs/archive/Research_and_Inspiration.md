# Research & Inspiration

**⚠️ NOTICE:** Active research implementation is now tracked in [RESEARCH_SYNTHESIS.md](../plans/RESEARCH_SYNTHESIS.md). This file is a staging area for new, un-mapped ideas.

## 🌟 Active Implementation Anchors
- **FS-Researcher** -> Persistent Memory Scaling.
- **TTCS** -> Test-Time Reasoning Loops.
- **WideSeek-R1** -> Multi-Agent Width Scaling.
- **Agentic-R** -> Utility-Based Retrieval.

## 📥 Staging: New Ideas (To be Mapped)
*None currently. All previous items have been distilled into the Synthesis Roadmap.*
