# Retrospective: Project Awakening [v4.8]
**Date:** Feb 15, 2026 | **Host:** Z87-Linux | **Tier:** Lead Engineer Portfolio
**Topic:** Hemispheric Concurrency, Conversational Physics, and Unitary Shutdown.

## 🏎️ 1. Preparation (One-Liner)
`curl -X POST http://localhost:9999/stop && export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$(pwd)/HomeLabAI/src && /home/jallred/Dev_Lab/HomeLabAI/.venv/bin/python3 HomeLabAI/src/debug/test_barge_in_logic.py`

## 🧪 2. Core Logic (The Accomplishments)
*   **Hemispheric Concurrency**: Implemented **Parallel Dispatch** in `acme_lab.py` (v3.7.15+). User queries are now broadcast to both Pinky and Brain simultaneously.
*   **Strategic Sentinel**: Ported the technical keyword list (`regression`, `validation`, `scars`, `root cause`) to trigger the Brain node autonomously when high-fidelity interjection is required.
*   **Barge-In Watchdog**: Restored conversational physics. Active processing tasks are now cancelled if the EarNode (NeMo) detects interrupt keywords ("stop", "wait", "hold on").
*   **Unitary Task Shutdown**: Resolved the persistent `aclose` task-mismatch hang by ensuring `AsyncExitStack` is managed within a single sequential async task.
*   **Federated Failover**: Hardened `loader.py` with dynamic `resolve_ip('KENDER')` and local fallback logic, ensuring KENDER (4090) resilience.

## 🤕 3. Scars (Lessons Learned)
*   **Weight Volatility**: The physical path to the converted Gemma 2 weights for vLLM was lost/untracked. **BKM**: Explicitly link model directories or maintain a `model_manifest.json` in the workspace.
*   **Context Sensitivity**: Async context managers (like `stdio_client`) are extremely sensitive to task boundaries in `anyio`. Mixing `async with` blocks with background tasks (`create_task`) for the same stack leads to RuntimeError.
*   **Logic over PIDs**: Verified that "End-to-End" tests (like `test_barge_in_logic.py`) are the only way to catch silent failures where a process is "online" but non-functional.

## 🎯 4. The Path Forward
1.  **Weight Recovery**: Locate or recreate the Gemma 2 2B LoRA weights for vLLM.
2.  **Silicon Gate 5**: Rerun `MULTI_LORA_PROBE` once weights are restored to verify concurrent adapter residency on 11GB.
3.  **Apollo 11**: Profile the full stack with KV Cache allocation active.
