# Deprecated & Discarded Ideas (Acme Lab)

This document tracks concepts that were explored but ultimately discarded.

## Components & Tools
*   **OpenNotebook (OpenNB):** A standalone RAG application.
    *   *Status:* **Deprioritized** in favor of direct Filesystem RAG (`rclone` mount + ChromaDB).
*   **"Pinky as Hype Man" (Pinky 1.0):** The idea that Pinky just says hello and passes the mic.
    *   *Status:* **Evolved** into "Pinky 2.0: The Agentic Facilitator."

*Note: The Wyoming Protocol and Direct Windows Client have been moved to `docs/plans/Future_Concepts.md` for potential future integration.*
